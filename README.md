# SaufBot

A Python program for the Raspberry Pi with which you can control a cocktail machine. The machine uses multiple pumps to pump the required liquid into a glass. Use the config.json file to configure the GPIO pins for the pumps and use the drinks.json file to configure which pumps pump which drink and what drinks there are.
